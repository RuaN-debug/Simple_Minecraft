# Simple Minecraft

Minecraft is a sandbox game made by Notch and now belongs to Mojang Studios. The game is focused on exploration, building, creating, fighting monsters and, most importantly, surviving, in a dinamically-generated map made of cubes. I always loved playing this game, ever since I was a kid and to be able to do just a small piece of this was really fun.

# Development

I created this really simple game by following a tutorial made by the channel Clear Code (https://www.youtube.com/ClearCode), the video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHSRaVeQxIk

His github repository: https://github.com/clear-code-projects/Minecraft-in-Python

# What can I do on the game?

It is really simple, you can jump with space, control the character with the arrows (up, down, left, right), destroy blocks with the left button of the mouse, create with the right button and change the blocks with z, x, c, v.

# How can I run the game?

First of all, you need to have python installed in your pc, you can find the latest version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
